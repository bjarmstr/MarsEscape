# MarsEscape
Mars Escape Room
--the main code for the Mars Escape Room is under the master branch ---  
(this was my first setup of a github project pushed through the Eclipse IDE and it has some master/main identity troubles)

Mars5 contains:

Python code for the Raspberry Pi's in each of the 4 assemblies which make up the oxygen system: OGA, CDRA, WPA and SRA.

Python code for the MarsControl Raspberry Pi which runs the start-up conditions, scenario conditions and tank levels.

Arudino code for the main controls of the CDRA & SRA assemblies. The CDRA Arduino also contains code for controlling the CO2 leak scenario.


Mars4 contains:

Flask based GUI for the administrator of the Escape Room
